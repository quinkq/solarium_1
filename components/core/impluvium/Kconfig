        default n
        help
            When enabled, bypasses critical safety checks for dry test runs:
            - Water level check: Returns fixed 50% level
            - Outlet pressure check: Returns fixed 0.5 bar (safe range)
            - Flow rate check: Bypassed during periodic safety monitoring
            
            Note: Temperature checks still use real TEMPESTA sensor.
            
            This is a compile-time flag - rebuild after changing.
